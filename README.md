# Django Table Booking App

A Django web application for managing restaurant table reservations.  
Users can register, log in, book tables, edit bookings, delete bookings, and reset passwords.

## Overview

The Django Table Booking App started as a simple CRUD dashboard and gradually evolved into a full booking management system with authentication, booking features, and a password reset flow.

It demonstrates incremental development:

- Start small with CRUD operations.
- Add authentication (register/login/logout).
- Add booking management (create/edit/delete bookings).
- Add a password reset feature with email support.

## Features

- User Registration & Login (email as username)
- Dashboard for personal bookings
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for bookings
- Forgot Password (with token & email via MailHog)
- Secure authentication with Djangoâ€™s built-in User model

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django (Python 3.x)
- **Database:** SQLite (default, easy for development)
- **Frontend:** Django Templates + Bootstrap
- **Email Testing:** MailHog (local SMTP testing)
